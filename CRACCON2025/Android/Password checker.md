**Chall Name** :- Password

**Solution**

The entire check happens on the native side. The input gets divided into 3 parts, and three different functions are used to check the input. One part of the input has to be received through the image in the drive link which will in `strings.xml`. Either of the image works but preffered to take `maybe.png`. 

Put the image into aperisolve, and one AES encrypted ciphertext will be there. To recognize it, `128` will be written beside it. Key is in the binary only. The other checks are basic reversing part.
